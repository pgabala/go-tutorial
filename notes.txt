variables
    creation
        inline
            var x int = 42
            x := 42
        
        block
            var (
                x int = 42
            )

        capitals
            at the package level if var is capitalized var is visible outside the package

        
    naming
        length of the var name should reflect the life of the variable
        accronyms should be all uppercase

operators
    := - a way to declare and assign a variable its value


primatives
    every time you initialize a var its has a "zero" value if its not set
    ex. bool = false


conversion
    ex. int(b)


constants
    ex. const myConst int = 42
    
    type can be inferred
    ex. const a = 42

    iota is a special value similar to a counter
    intial value of iota is the "zero" value of a type
